 Basic learning files CSS
 
 The following MD are intended to cover a some basic CSS properties and are intended as a starter into how CSS is used.
 
A QUICK TIP BEFORE STARTING... Online coding sites are excellent places to practise coding and help you with syntax and storage they are so easy to use and have a browser window that updates to show you how your code would look. 

I have used CodePen and CodeSandBox they are very good and the later can be linked to your GitHub repos.

This can be achieved with Visual Code and its many extensions but will require some time to setup and learn how to use.
